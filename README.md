Given the HTML and CSS, write the JavaScript to create a Bingo game. Based on the classic American version of the game, we will be using a 5x5 Bingo card.

## Bingo 1

In Bingo 1 (of three) we will create the following:

* **Interaction:** A Bingo ball, that when clicked, displays a valid Bingo number. e.g. "N42" --> "B" (numbers 1–15), "I" (numbers 16–30), "N" (numbers 31–45), "G" (numbers 46–60), and "O" (numbers 61–75)
* **Functions:** You will create functions to:
  - output an array of valid Bingo values
  - get a random Bingo value
  - display that value on the Bingo ball
* **Data:** we will keep track which balls were "called" (by clicking on the ball), and also make sure our Bingo values do not repeat during the game
